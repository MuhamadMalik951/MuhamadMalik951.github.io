# Hi, I'm Muhamad Malik! 👋
👋  I'm a Software developer passionate about building efficient and user-friendly applications. I work with React, Next.js, Node.js, and Tailwind CSS, constantly learning new tools like TypeScript and Express.

🌱 Currently, I'm focusing on backend development with Node.js and enhancing my skills in TypeScript.

💼 I've completed several projects through The Odin Project and enjoy contributing to open-source and collaborating on GitHub.

🔍 I'm particularly interested in creating service-based platforms that connect users with professionals in various fields, inspired by my recent project idea for a service marketplace.

✉️ I'm open to collaborations and new opportunities—feel free to reach out!
